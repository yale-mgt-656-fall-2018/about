Software is a ubiquitous component of the increasingly technology-driven
economy. Or, "_Software is eating the world_" in the words of Marc
Andreessen. Students in this course will learn 1) management of the
software development lifecycle and 2) basic technology skills for
creating modern mobile-friendly web applications. The management
techniques will include hiring technical teams as well as planning,
implementing, and maintaining software projects. We will focus on
"[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)"
methods for software development, using these methods to
develop a mobile web application in teams. The course will build a
foundational understanding of version control, databases, and
programming on a modern web stack using
[HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), &
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Some experience programming
would be beneficial, though not necessary for the motivated student.
The course is most appropriate for students who will have leadership
roles in industries being disrupted by technology, or launching new
ventures with a software or web component.

Usually, 656 has about 65 students and 660 about 30.
Most spots are reserved for students enrolled in the
Yale School of Management. These students may bid on the course using the SOM
bidding system. The remaining spots in the course are open to the
non-SOM students, including Yale College, who
may shop the course. (In the case of excess demand, the best performing
students shopping will be invited to stay in the course.) Officially
registering for Yale College students will require a form that
is signed by your dean and Kyle Jensen. You can print these forms
online (somewhere).

## Course Philosophy

If you are interested in software and technology, we think this
will be one of the best courses you take at Yale. We designed
the course with the following values.

- **You will actually write code**. If you are going to manage developers,
  you need to understand what it is like to write code. You need to
  speak their language, understand their struggles, and understand
  some computer science basics.

- **You will use modern best-practices for managing software development**.
  There are many ways in which one can organize
  software development teams. We will teach you
  "[scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)",
  a popular
  take on agile software development methods. If you go on to be a
  product manager at a major technology company&mdash;Google, Apple,
  Microsoft, etc.&mdash;you will most likely employ some variant of scrum.

- **You will use a modern technology stack, working on both the client
  and server side**.
  On the client side we will use web technologies
  including [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
  [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
  [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Delivering software via the
  web is a common choice because browsers are ubiquitous: they exist
  on every phone, tablet, laptop, and computer. On the server side we
  will use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Node is "lightweight and efficient, perfect for
  data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed
  devices."

These are bold goals and challenging to accomplish in the brief time
allotted to us. Our greatest concern is that the technology component
will be a barrier for some students. To ensure that this is not the
case, we recorded numerous videos in which the instructors show how
to complete the homework and class project.
In these videos, we discuss the
different ways in which technical goals can be achieved, explicitly
show how to write the code you need, and how to use the different
services we are employing. You will get real experience
with real modern web technologies. That experience should be
pleasurable, hands-on, and minimally frustrating.

## Sections

The class information and policies are divided into the
following sections.

## How to use this document/repo

Because our class info and policies are tracked using
git, you can see if and how they change over the course
of the semester. Further, you have the ability to make
changes yourself---please send me a pull request. Similarly,
if you feel these documents are lacking, please open an
"issue" on GitHub for this repo and we'll address the
issue. Finally, because our git repo is hosted on GitHub, you
can easily receive push notifications of changes to this repo.
