## Notes on particular aspects of the course

## Lectures

This course often uses a [flipped classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom),
meaning that you will learn
a great deal of material prior to class and our time in the classroom,
together is spent

- summarizing the most important points;
- discussing the material; and,
- applying the material through activites, homework, or the class project.

Nearly every lecture has a set of required readings that you
will need to complete before class. Often, those readings will
include videos. After completing the
readings and prior to class, you will complete a short quiz
online (see below for more details) and also submit questions
via our Q&A system (more below also).

Class meetings are 80 minutes long.
In class, we will typically have
a "mini-lecture" and discussion through which we will recapitulate the
most important points of the readings. In most meetings, we will also
have some "activity". This
may include discussing your semester project or a guest speaker.

The activities in class will sometimes require that you have
a computer with you. You will require access to the network
and often access to a Unix-like computing environment. (Students using
an operating system not based on Unix may like to use a remote Unix-like host,
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), or a cloud environment
like [Cloud9](http://c9.io).)

### Quizzes

Most classes are preceeded by a short quiz. The quizzes will be
completed online _prior_ to the lectures. They usually consist of
multiple choice questions that test whether 1) the student completed
the assigned readings and video lectures; and, 2) understood the
most important concepts. Each quiz is timed: students have 15 minutes
to complete them once they are started. The nature of the questions
on the quizzes will vary. Some questions are simple and factual,
some test understanding, others require synthesis or research. You
take the quizzes through the class website.

I believe in pre-class quizzes and students in my previous classes indicated
that they were highly satisfied with the quizzing practices. Further, there is sound
empirical evidence that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
increases your understanding and retention of material.
I believe the strongest arguments, from your perspective as a student, for frequent quizzes are as follows:

- they give you a small reward for coming to class prepared;
- they eliminate the need for cold calling, which creates a better classroom atmosphere;
- they ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with;
- they are short, and you can drop your lowest scores, so they are not stressful;
- they allow you to accumulate your grade gradually throughout the semester, instead of relying on large exams (there are still exams in class, but their worth less than they'd be without quizzes);
- they allow you to develop a grade that is independent from your group project;
- they give us the freedom to use class for more enjoyable activities, confident that we all have a shared body of knowledge.

### Participation

Your participation in class improves the learning experience
for everybody: me, your colleagues, and yourself. Participation
is [recorded](https://github.com/kljensen/yelukerest/blob/master/db/src/data/yeluke/engagement.sql) on a per-class basis by the teaching staff.
See the
[grading notes](grading.md) for more information.

### The class project

See the [class project](class-project.md) section.

## Compromises

We would like to share with you some of the rationale for decisions we made
in designing the class project, with a focus on the compromises.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will on Canvas or otherwise
online.
